==============

[![Dependency Status](http://img.shields.io/david/hashdog/node-freshbooks-api.svg?style=flat-square)](https://david-dm.org/hashdog/node-freshbooks-api)

A node.js wrapper for the FreshBooks API.

The author of https://github.com/prattsj/freshbooksjs has not maintain module for a long time (since Apr 2014). Some important fixes has been sent and we need that.


### Installation

    npm install freshbooks-api


### tl;dr

##### Standard resource CRUD methods:

* list(cb)
* get(id, cb)
* create(data, cb)
* update(data, cb)
* delete(id, cb)



##### Examples:

Get all invoices for the user:
```javascript
var FreshBooks = require('freshbooks-api');
var freshbooks = new FreshBooks('USER_URL', 'USER_TOKEN');

freshbooks.estimate.list(function(error, estimates) {

    /* do things */
});

```

Get a *specific* invoice:
```javascript
freshbooks.estimate.get(1, function(error, estimate) {

    /* moar things */
});

```

Update an estimate:
```javascript
freshbooks.estimate.update(data, function(error, estimate) {

    /* aw snap */
});

```

Create a new invoice:
```javascript
freshbooks.estimate.create(data, function(error, estimate) {

    /* here we go */
});

```

Delete an estimate:
```javascript
freshbooks.estimate.delete(1, function(error) {

    /* that's what's up */
});

```


### Authentication
http://developers.freshbooks.com/authentication-2/

Authenticating is easy. Pass in strings with the user's API URL and token when creating a client:
```javascript
var FreshBooks = require('freshbooks-api');
var freshbooks = new FreshBooks('USER_URL', 'USER_TOKEN');
```

Change the token at any time. Note that this will affect & auto-update the token for any "sub-services" (for clients, time entries, etc.) accessed via this client instance:
```javascript
var FreshBooks = require('freshbooks-api');
var freshbooks = new FreshBooks();

/* stuff happens... */

freshbooks.config.token = 'NEW_TOKEN';
freshbooks.config.url = 'NEW_URL';
```
